# How I Built This Extension!

Before starting the actual development of the 'Absolute Enable Copy & Image Reader' Chrome extension, we first need to understand what a Chrome extension is. Chrome extensions are small tools or software pieces that can be installed in browsers to add extra features, enhancing our browsing experience.

To make a simple extension you need simple web technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, along with some knowledge of web development. You will be pleased to know that our straightforward "Absolute Enable Copy & Image Reader" Chrome extension is built using these technologies.

Creating a Chrome extension is similar to creating a web application, but it requires a manifest.json file which we will discuss in this post.

Have you ever tried to copy important text from a website but couldn’t because it disabled the copy and right-click functions?

You can solve this with a handy browser extension that lets users right-click and copy, even on restrictive sites. Want to upgrade your browser experience? Here’s a simple step-by-step guide to making this extension from scratch.

# 1. Setting Up Your Workspace

First, you need a special folder (or “directory”) where all your files will live.

📂 Create a New folder named “Extension Name” on your computer.

Inside “Extension Name“, make these folders:

‘js‘ (for code stuff)
‘images‘ (for pictures)
‘css‘ (for style stuff)
This organization ensures that our files are well-structured and easy to locate.

#2. The Heart: Manifest File

Every extension begins with a manifest.json file. This is like an ID card for your extension. This crucial file provides metadata about the extension: its name, version, permissions, and more.

First of all, we need the VS Code editor where we will write our HTML, CSS, or JavaScript code. So, download Visual Studio Code and install it on your PC or laptop. Now

Open Visual Studio Code on Your PC.
Go To File > Open Folder > Select “Extension Name” folder
Go To File > New File > Create a Manifest.json File

After creating a Manifest.json file, paste this HTML boilerplate code:

{
    "manifest_version": 3,
    "name": "Extension Name",
    "version": "1.0.0",
    "description": "Extension Description",
    "action": {
        "default_popup": "popup.html",
        "default_icon": {
            "16": "images/16px.png",
            "48": "images/48px.png",
            "128": "images/logo.png"
        }
    },
    "background": {
        "service_worker": "background.js"
    },
    "permissions": ["activeTab", "storage", "scripting"],
    "icons": {
        "16": "images/16px.png",
        "48": "images/48px.png",
        "128": "images/logo.png"
    }
}
